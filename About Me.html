                Hi There!
            </h1>
            <p>
                I am Carl Michael Archangel M. Duldulao. I am currently 21 years old. I have a pretty big passion about programming. 
                When it comes to all of my subjects programming subjects interest me the most. 
                I am not really sure why I am very interested in programming but I think it's about 
                the problem solving and I like to think stuff such as how to solve a problem specially when I have nothing to do.
                <br><br>
                When I was in high school what I really want to pursue was marine engineering because I think the course will be fun 
                and will interest me but my problem was I donâ€™t know how to swim. I am a shy type person so learning to swim during 
                college makes me doubt about myself in pursuing that course. I tried to learn how to swim but failed to learn it 
                maybe swimming is not just for me. Although my dreams of becoming a marine engineer is far from becoming a reality 
                I pursued my second choice which is information technology growing up I have experience in fixing computer on my own 
                because I have a faulty desktop computer. At first when I enrolled information technology, I thought IT has a mix of 
                computer hardware and software but I was wrong IT is mostly software-based subject. Still, I enjoyed this course 
                specially the programming part which always interest me. One day I am dreaming to be a software engineer that can 
                be a good asset to the company that I am going to work with.
